## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project i could learn more about DOM manipulation, async programming, fetch, promises and JS in general. I decided to do this challenge because i wanted to practice my Vanilla JS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This helped me to remember how to use it in vanilla JS.
